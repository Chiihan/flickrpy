#summary This is a cleaned up version of the "TODO List" included with Flickr.py
#labels Incomplete

For individual API functions/methods that I have implemented in Flickr.py, I will add documentation to an individual wiki page explaining how to use a number of them, as some may be slightly complicated to allow for maximum flexibility (not overly complicated, but may need a paragraph of explaining to understand how to use).

== flickr.blogs.* ==

I am currently working on adding blogging API functionality to flickr.py. Retriving the list of blogs is near completion.

Due to the reliance on authentication in these flickr API functions/modules, I am making improvements to the authentication system, which will make much of the authentication documentation currently written obsolete. For example: Currently, you need to manually make an API Signature, and manually sort all the parameters into alphabetical order. This will be done automatically when the new improvements (near completion) are implemented.
